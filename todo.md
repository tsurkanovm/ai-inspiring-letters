- needs to run chapter converting for those left notes (they are in different languages and probably too long). 
So I need to adjust prompt in notes-by-chapters-coverting.py
- fixed book name in import cause it has special characters and service suffixes
- adapt send letter script for the case when all records were sent
- check the converting to chunks error log (few chunks were skipped)
